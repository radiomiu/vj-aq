# Getting Started with demo AQI project

This web page prototype supports both English and Hindi languages.
For further improvements I'd like to add:
- tests
- filterable select with autosuggestions
- interactive SVG map of India, with tooltips on hover over the specified region, or city.
Regions could be coloured according to the median AQ in this location. 
- maybe, some polyfills support for IE, although I didnt use anything specific.
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
